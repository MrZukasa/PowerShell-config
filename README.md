hub browse login must be like:
```
I'm sorry for the inconvenience. GitHub deprecated its Authorizations API, which hub relied on for exchanging a password for a token.

Until we fix this in hub, the solution is to generate a Personal Access Token (with at least repo scope) at https://github.com/settings/tokens and paste it instead of the password.
```
